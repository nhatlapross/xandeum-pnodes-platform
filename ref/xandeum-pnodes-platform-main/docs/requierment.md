About Xandeum Labs
Xandeum is building a scalable storage layer for Solana dApps. We think of it as a second tier of Solana accounts that can grow to exabytes and beyond. This lives on its own network of storage provider nodes, which we call pNodes.
Mission
Develop an analytics platform for Xandeum pNodes, similar to existing Solana validator dashboards like stakewiz.com, topvalidators.app or validators.app.
Scope Detail
Create a web-based analytics platform for Xandeum pNodes.
The platform should retrieve a list of all pNodes appearing in gossip using pNode RPC (pRPC) calls - see xandeum.network and click “Docs”.
Display the information for these pNodes to the user.
The complexity and features beyond the basic display are entirely up to the developer.

Submission Requirements
A link to a live, functional website or a GitHub repository containing the platform's code.
The platform must be accessible and usable for review.
Documentation on how to deploy and use the platform, if applicable.
Judging Criteria
Functionality: The platform must successfully retrieve and display pNode information using valid pRPC calls.
Clarity: The information presented should be easy to understand.
User Experience: How intuitive and user-friendly the platform is.
Innovation (Optional): Integration of additional features or unique ways to present data will be a plus, but not required for the base bounty.
