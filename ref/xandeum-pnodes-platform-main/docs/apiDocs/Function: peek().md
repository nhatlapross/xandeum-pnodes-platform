A stringified integer representing the file system ID in which the file resides.

### path

`string`

The path to the file to be peeked.

The starting byte offset (inclusive) to begin reading from.

### endPosition

`number`

The ending byte offset (exclusive) to stop reading at.

### wallet

`PublicKey`

The public key of the wallet that will sign and authorize the transaction.

## Returns

`Promise`\<`Transaction`>

A Promise that resolves to a Solana `Transaction` object containing the peek instruction.
